## To design and implement a URL hashing system that addresses the challenges of long URLs with UTM tracking, we need to create a solution that:

1. Maintains the integrity of the original URL, including query parameters.
2. Generates a unique and shorter representation of the original URL.
3. Tracks clicks on the hashed URL.
4. Offers options for single-use URLs and expiration times.
5. Ensures privacy and security.
